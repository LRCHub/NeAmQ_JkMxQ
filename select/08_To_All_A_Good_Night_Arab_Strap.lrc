[00:33.95] Lost on Christmas Eve eve,
[00:42.45] He threw something down my neck.
[00:49.16] I didn't check what it was.
[00:55.46] When he says "Trust me," I never need to check.
[01:03.39] Then he helped me up,
[01:10.22] And the next thing I know we were lying naked and it had started to snow.
[02:00.13] So I was late for work - Hungover, dazed, and freezing.
[02:14.13] But we still made time to demonstrate how we'll wear it, come the season.
[02:28.38] Not a creature stirred. No mother, no mouse.
[02:42.33] But I still tip-toed down the hall and sneaked out of the house.

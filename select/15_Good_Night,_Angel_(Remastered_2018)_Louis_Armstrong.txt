Goodnight angel
Thanks for another evening in heaven
Just one more kiss to end this perfect day
Before you spread your wings and fly away

Goodnight angel
Until we meet again here in heaven
And may your dreams be just as sweet as you are
Goodnight, angel, goodnight

(Orchestral Interlude)

(Trio)
Goodnight angel
Thanks for another evening in heaven
Just one more kiss to end this perfect day
Before you spread your wings and fly away

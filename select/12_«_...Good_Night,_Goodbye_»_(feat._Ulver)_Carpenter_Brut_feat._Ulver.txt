Hey, close your eyes and pray
There's nothing left to say
The film is black and white
Nineteen-twenty nine
The great depression
A man comes around
He comes around
And he drinks the black milk
Runs down the potter's ground
Lines of light throughout the city
The white noise
Speed of sound
There's nothing left to say
Close your eyes and pray
Now close your eyes and cry
Under the television sky
Say thank you, good night
Goodbye
Now close your eyes and cry
Under the television sky
Say thank you, good night
Good
